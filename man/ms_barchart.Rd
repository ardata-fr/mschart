\usage{
ms_barchart(data, x, y, group = NULL, labels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame}

\item{x}{x colname}

\item{y}{y colname}

\item{group}{grouping colname used to split data into series. Optional.}

\item{labels}{colnames of columns to be used as labels into series. Optional.
If more than a name, only the first one will be used as label, but all
labels (transposed if a group is used) will be available in the Excel file
associated with the chart.}

\description{
Creation of a barchart object that can be
inserted in a 'Microsoft' document.

Bar charts illustrate comparisons among individual items. In a bar chart, the
categories are typically organized along the vertical axis, and the values
along the horizontal axis.

Consider using a bar chart when:
\itemize{
\item The axis labels are long.
\item The values that are shown are durations.
}
