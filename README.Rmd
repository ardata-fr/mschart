The `mschart` package provides a framework for easily create charts for 'Microsoft PowerPoint' documents. It has to be used with package [`officer`](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer) that will produce 
the charts in new or existing PowerPoint or Word documents.

**The user documentation can be read [here](https://ardata-fr.github.io/mschart/articles/introduction.html).**

**Functions you should be aware of are documented [here](https://ardata-fr.github.io/mschart/reference/index.html).**


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a line chart.

```{r example}
library(mschart)
library(officer)

linec <- ms_linechart(data = iris, x = "Sepal.Length",
                      y = "Sepal.Width", group = "Species")
linec <- chart_ax_y(linec, num_fmt = "0.00", rotation = -90)
```

Then use package `officer` to send the object as a chart.

```{r eval=FALSE}
doc <- read_pptx()
doc <- add_slide(doc, layout = "Title and Content", master = "Office Theme")
doc <- ph_with_chart(doc, chart = linec)

print(doc, target = "example.pptx")
```

At any moment, you can type `print(your_chart, preview = TRUE)` to preview the chart in a temporary PowerPoint file. This requires to have a PowerPoint Viewer installed on the machine.

## Installation

You can get the development version from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ardata-fr/mschart")
```

Or the latest version on CRAN:

### Contributing to the package development

A great way to start is to contribute an example or improve the documentation.

If you want to submit a Pull Request to integrate functions of yours, please provide:

* the new function(s) with code and roxygen tags (with examples)
* a new section in the appropriate vignette that describes how to use the new function
* add corresponding tests in directory `tests/testthat`.

By using rhub (run `rhub::check_for_cran()`), you will see if everything is ok.
When submitted, the PR will be evaluated automatically on travis and appveyor and you will be able to see if something broke.
